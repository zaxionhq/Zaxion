  "product_overview": "The GitHub Test Case Generator is a developer productivity tool that integrates directly with GitHub repositories to analyze codebases, generate meaningful test cases (unit, integration, and functional tests), and optionally push these tests back to the repository via pull requests. It automates repetitive test writing tasks, enhances test coverage, improves software quality, and seamlessly fits into existing CI/CD workflows.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Automate test case generation to reduce developer manual effort.",
    "Improve code quality by increasing test coverage and detecting uncovered code areas.",
    "Provide seamless integration with GitHub repositories through OAuth authentication and repository management.",
    "Enable AI-assisted static code analysis and test generation supporting multiple testing frameworks.",
    "Facilitate easy preview, customization, and automated pull request creation for generated tests."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "GitHub OAuth-based authentication for secure access.",
    "Repository connection and browsing with support for private and public repos.",
    "AI-powered static code analysis to identify uncovered functions, classes, endpoints.",
    "Generation of unit, integration, and API/functional tests using popular frameworks like Jest, PyTest, JUnit, and Mocha.",
    "Automated pull request creation with branch generation for review workflows.",
    "Dashboard presenting repository details, coverage statistics before and after test generation, and manual regeneration controls.",
    "Support for custom test preferences such as testing library choices and coding styles.",
    "Error handling with error boundaries, toast notifications, and centralized API error handling.",
    "UI components including theme toggle, loading indicators, code viewer, and chatbot assistance."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User logs in via GitHub OAuth to authenticate and obtain repository access.",
    "User selects one or more repositories to analyze and manage.",
    "The system fetches and scans the selected repository code using AI to detect uncovered or weakly tested areas.",
    "Generated test cases are previewed by the user, who can customize options if desired.",
    "User chooses to commit tests directly to a branch or create a pull request for team review.",
    "Developer reviews the pull request and merges the changes upon approval.",
    "Dashboard allows users to view connected repositories, test coverage statistics, and regenerate tests as needed."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Successful OAuth authentication and repository connection to GitHub APIs.",
    "Accurate identification of uncovered code areas and correct generation of test cases.",
    "Generated tests cover unit, integration, and functional aspects according to selected frameworks.",
    "Pull requests are properly created with generated test branches and visible for team review.",
    "UI components function correctly including theme toggling, loading states, error boundaries, and chatbot assistance.",
    "Error handling mechanisms provide clear user feedback for issues and API errors.",
    "System metrics such as increased test coverage and developer time saved meet defined success metrics."

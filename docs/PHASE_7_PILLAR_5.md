# Phase 7: Pillar 5 — Public Narrative & Open-Core Boundary (The Launch)

## **1. Purpose**
Define what Zaxion is, why it exists, and how it differentiates itself in the market. This pillar ensures that the public narrative matches the architectural reality and establishes trust with the broader developer community.

---

## **2. Core Deliverables**

### **A. Open Architecture Docs**
*   **Focus**: Transparency on the deterministic derivation and governance flow.
*   **Goal**: Enable architectural auditability and interface-level verification. External researchers can audit the logic and flow of Zaxion without requiring proprietary internal code.
*   **Content**: Detailed flowcharts of Phases 1-5 and canonical data schemas.

### **B. The Public Glossary**
*   **Terms**:
    *   **Facts**: Raw observables from the repository (The Truth).
    *   **The Judge**: The deterministic engine that executes policies (The Law).
    *   **Verdict**: The final `PASS/BLOCK/WARN` result (The Judgment).
    *   **Override**: A signed, time-bound exception (The Mercy).

### **C. Threat Model & Trust Guarantees**
*   **Publication**: A whitepaper explaining how Zaxion handles secrets, GitHub tokens, and code privacy.
*   **Code Privacy Invariant**: Zaxion does not store your source code permanently. 
    *   **Transient Access**: Code is accessed in-memory during the **Fact Collection (Phase 2)** window and purged immediately after the `FactSnapshot` is generated.
    *   **Permanent Storage**: Only the minimal, non-reversible `FactSnapshot` (metadata, line counts, counts of violations) is persisted to the database.

## **3. Key Invariants**
1.  **Never Oversell AI**: Marketing must never claim AI is making the "Decision." AI is strictly an **Advisor**.
2.  **No Hidden Mechanics**: The logic for a `BLOCK` must always be visible to the end-user (Pillar 6.1). No "Proprietary Magic" in the verdict.
3.  **Transparency > Marketing**: If the system fails or has a limitation, it must be documented openly. Trust is the primary currency.

---

## **4. Public Claims Scope & Guarantees**
To maintain trust and prevent marketing drift, the following scopes are explicitly defined:
*   **Guaranteed**:
    *   **Deterministic Verdicts**: For a given `FactSnapshot` and `PolicyBundle`, the `Verdict` will always be the same.
    *   **Auditability**: Every decision can be traced back to its specific facts and policy versions.
*   **Best-Effort**:
    *   **AI Advice Quality**: Remediation hints and explanations are generated by LLMs; while tuned for accuracy, they are advisory and may contain inaccuracies.
    *   **Evaluation Latency**: While p95 is targeted at < 2s, network and GitHub API performance are variables outside Zaxion's direct control.
*   **Non-Guaranteed**:
    *   **External Service Uptime**: Zaxion cannot guarantee the availability of GitHub, Slack, or other third-party integration points.
    *   **Developer Intent Inference**: The system judges code state (Facts), not the developer's unstated intent.

---

## **5. Open-Core Boundary**
*   **The "Core" (Open)**: 
    *   The `FactSnapshot` schema.
    *   The Deterministic Judge interface.
    *   Basic checkers (Coverage, File Extensions).
*   **The "Cloud/Enterprise" (Proprietary)**: 
    *   AI-Assisted Remediation.
    *   Advanced Governance Analytics.
    *   SSO/RBAC integrations.
    *   Managed Simulation Engine.

---

## **6. Outcome Goals**
*   **Community Trust**: Developers feel comfortable using Zaxion because they understand its boundaries.
*   **Contributor Interest**: Clear paths for the community to add new "Checkers" to the open core.
*   **Investor Clarity**: A clearly defined business model based on the Open-Core strategy.

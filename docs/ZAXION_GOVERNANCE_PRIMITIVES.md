# Zaxion Governance Primitives

This document defines the core primitives of the Zaxion Governance Layer (Phase 4). These definitions ensure that the system remains a source of truth, accountability, and trust at scale.

---

### 1. What is a Policy?
A **Policy** is a declarative set of rules and constraints that define the "Success Criteria" for a Pull Request. 
- It is the "Law" of the codebase.
- It is owned by a human (Policy Owner) who is responsible for its logic and noise level.
- It can be scoped to an entire Organization or a specific Repository.

### 2. What is a Policy Version?
A **Policy Version** is an immutable snapshot of a Policy at a specific point in time.
- Because policies evolve, the system must know exactly which version of the "Law" was used to judge a PR.
- Decisions are forever linked to the Version ID that created them.
- This prevents "historical drift" where changing a policy today would make a 6-month-old decision look invalid.

### 3. What is an Override?
An **Override** is a deliberate human intervention to bypass a "BLOCK" or "WARN" state generated by a Policy.
- An override does not "fix" the violation; it "accepts" the violation for a specific context.
- Every override requires a human-provided justification (the "Why").
- Overrides are signals that the policy might be too strict or the situation is exceptional.

### 4. What is an Override Signature?
An **Override Signature** is the immutable audit trail of an Override.
- It is the "Fingerprint" of accountability.
- It contains: `Who (Actor ID)` + `When (Timestamp)` + `Why (Justification)` + `Which (Decision ID)`.
- In a governance review, the Signature is the evidence used to determine who is responsible for a bypass.

### 5. What is a Role?
A **Role** is a defined set of permissions assigned to a human identity within the Zaxion system.
- Roles determine the "Scope of Authority."
- Examples:
    - `Developer`: Can view decisions and request overrides.
    - `Repo-Lead`: Can grant overrides and edit repo-level policies.
    - `Org-Admin`: Can define global policies and create Non-Overridable rules.

### 6. What is a Policy Strength Level?
A **Policy Strength Level** defines the rigidity of a rule and its susceptibility to human intervention.
- **MANDATORY**: Non-overridable by standard actors. Requires high-privilege Org-Admin intervention.
- **OVERRIDABLE_WITH_APPROVAL**: Requires a signature from a different authorized actor than the PR author.
- **ADVISORY**: Generates warnings but does not block the PR. Overridable by the PR author with a justification.

### 7. What is Policy Jurisdiction?
**Policy Jurisdiction** defines how rules are inherited, narrowed, or resolved in case of conflict.
- **Inheritance Rule**: Repos inherit all Org-level policies.
- **Narrowing vs. Weakening**: A Repo-level policy can *narrow* a rule (make it stricter) but cannot *weaken* it (make it more lenient) if the Org-level rule is marked MANDATORY.
- **Conflict Resolution**: In cases of conflicting rules, the highest authority (Org > Repo) and highest strength (Mandatory > Advisory) takes precedence.

### 8. What is Override Scoping & Expiry?
**Override Scoping** prevents "policy erosion" by ensuring overrides do not become permanent exemptions.
- **PR-Specific**: The override only applies to the current Pull Request.
- **Commit-Specific**: If new commits are pushed, the override is invalidated and must be re-evaluated.
- **Time-Boxed**: An override may expire after a set duration (e.g., "7 days for a temporary fix").
- **Auto-Expiry**: All overrides auto-expire upon PR merge or closure.

### 9. What are Anti-Abuse Safeguards?
**Anti-Abuse Safeguards** are structural constraints that prevent bad-faith actions by users, regardless of their role.
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: No one, not even an Admin, can delete or edit an Override Signature or Policy Version history.
- **Visibility Asymmetry**: Managers and Admins are subject to *more* scrutiny, not less. Their overrides are automatically flagged for higher-level review.
- **Bypass Velocity Thresholds**: Repeated overrides of the same policy by the same actor trigger an "Abuse Alert" to prevent policy degradation under pressure.

### 10. What is Policy Change Impact Radius?
**Policy Change Impact Radius** is the calculated scope of effect that a policy update will have across the organization.
- **Blast Radius Preview**: Before a new Policy Version is enforced, the system calculates which repositories and active PRs will be affected.
- **Informational Signaling**: Stakeholders (Policy Owners and Repo Leads) are notified of the change and its potential impact before the "Law" is officially updated.
- **Drift Analysis**: Identifying how many existing "PASS" decisions would become "FAIL" under the new version.
